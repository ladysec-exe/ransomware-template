This is a simple ransomware wich will display a image on the victims PC and disable their input. 
It's written in python and dependancies need to be installed prior.


    Good usage cases include but are not limited to:

    RCE exploits
    Phishing
    Trojan attacks

PLEASE use this responsibly, I claim no legal fault for any misuse of this program.

    btw, this script will not work on all systems, it's lightly tested on Windows.




Love, -AngelSec
